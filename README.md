## AVM::AHA

### Description

This small library allows programmatic access to AVM's home automation
system. It uses the HTTP protocol as specified in
http://www.avm.de/de/Extern/files/session_id/AHA-HTTP-Interface.pdf

To install and build the modules:

````bash
     perl ./Build.PL
     ./Build install
````

For more information, see the manpage to AVM::AHA.

### Example

````perl
    my $aha = new AVM::AHA({host: "fritz.box", password: "s!cr!t"});

    # Get all switches as array ref of AVM::AHA::Switch objects
    my $switches = $aha->list();

    # For all switches found
    for my $switch (@$switches) {
       say "Name:    ",$switch->name();
       say "State:   ",$switch->is_on();
       say "Present: ",$switch->is_present()
       say "Energy:  ",$switch->energy();
       say "Power:   ",$switch->power();

       # If switch is on, switch if off and vice versa
       $switch->is_on() ? $switch->off() : $switch->on();
    }

    # Access switch directly via name as configured 
    $aha->energy("Lava lamp");

    # ... or by AIN
    $aha->energy("087610077197");
